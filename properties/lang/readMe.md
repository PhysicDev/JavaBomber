### lang file : 
theses files contain all the texts that apear in the game, if you want to add a new translation, just add a new properties file, then fill it like the existing one.

There are no constraint except one : **make sure that the PRE field of the properties files match the name of the file**. for example if your file is named FR.properties, then the **PRE** field should be assigned to the value FR.

also the font i used don't work with special character like **é**, **à** or **ç**, so use only letter without accent.
